		<h1>Goodbye Philly</h1>
		<h4>{{date}}</h4>
		<p>When it was all said and done, it was time to leave Philadelphia and head back to Laurel.  Driving back from Philly, it was a little sad leaving.  I really enjoyed Philadelphia.  It's true what they say; Sometimes the unexpected things in life can truly be the best.  But at the same time, we had bigger adventures ahead.  One thing I really liked about Philly was the culture.  A perfect blend of history and modern wonders, there are lots of adventures to be had in Philly.  Heading back was obviously much of the same, since we took the same route.  Jenn did some driving as Neal was incredibly pooped.</p>

		<h1>Chido's Review</h1>
		<h4>{{date}}</h4>
		<p>With Neal asleep in the back seat and Jenn and I hungry, we both decided Mexican food sounded good.  Once we arrived at Neal’s place, he suggested the same, so it was off to Chido’s, a Tex Mex restaurant next to our hotel (how convenient).  We got there just before the kitchen closed (a common theme throughout the trip).  I ordered the typical Margarita, while Jenn had a Virgin mystery flavored Mojito (I think it was Mango, maybe it was Melon).  For food, I got creative and ordered a Taco Salad with Chicken.  A tasty meal, but a bit too fulfilling for me.  The chips and salsa provided was also enjoyable, though not legendary by any means.</p>
