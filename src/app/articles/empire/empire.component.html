		<h1>Look at That!</h1>
		<h4>{{date}}</h4>
		<p>Our first sight to see was the Empire State Building.  It was pointless to drive and park, so our first Subway ride was in store, with a line near us with direct access.  It felt like every TV show or movie I've seen regarding the NY Subway, but to see it in person made it felt more hectic, from the weird turnstiles to the long trips just to find the exit.  Getting on the Subway was just as crazy as the Metro, except I was able to keep the door open just enough for Jenn to scream her way onto the Subway like a little girl.  Some people laughed, but I politely explained to them what had happened on the Metro the day before.  Other than that, it was a typical Subway ride.  Just like the movies.</p>
		<p>Getting off the Subway, we were blocks away from the Empire State Building.  As I looked up, I could see the building with much amazement.  I pulled Jenn over to show her as well.  She was amazed.  Entering the building was just as beautiful as the exterior.  The classic architecture and structure makes it one of a kind.  Beautiful in every way, we got our tickets and went through another line, seeing Museum like visuals.  Eventually we got on an elevator.  Approximately 55 seconds later, the three of us were up on the 80th floor to see the introductory views.</p>
		<p>Looking out the windows showed how incredibly huge New York was.  Tall buildings everywhere, next tour each other, and water around Manhattan and beyond.  It felt like a futuristic city at times with all the unique buildings one by one by one.  I was absolutely in awe.  The only experience I'd had prior was of course, the (former) Sears Tower in Chicago.  I even wore the same University of Minnesota shirt I wore to Chicago 10 years prior to signify the event.  Certainly, Chicago rivals in views, but New York was larger on all sides.  Chicago, sitting on the edge of Lake Michigan, gave the view a three sided view rather than four.  Great views, but nothing like New York.  After walking to each side to take multiple pictures, we had one more elevator ride to the 86th floor, where even better views were available.</p>
