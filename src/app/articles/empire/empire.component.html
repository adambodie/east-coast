		<h1>Look at That!</h1>
		<h4>{{date}}</h4>
		<p>Our first sight to see was the Empire State Building.  It was pointless to drive and park, so our first Subway ride was in store, with a line near us with direct access.  It felt like every TV show or movie I've seen regarding the NY Subway, but to see it in person made it felt more hectic, from the weird turnstiles to the long trips just to find the exit.  Getting on the Subway was just as crazy as the Metro, except I was able to keep the door open just enough for Jenn to scream her way onto the Subway like a little girl.  Some people laughed, but I politely explained to them what had happened on the Metro the day before.  Other than that, it was a typical Subway ride.  Just like the movies.</p>
		<p>Getting off the Subway, we were blocks away from the Empire State Building.  As I looked up, I could see the building with much amazement.  I pulled Jenn over to show her as well.  She was amazed.  Entering the building was just as beautiful as the exterior.  The classic architecture and structure makes it one of a kind.  Beautiful in every way, we got our tickets and went through another line, seeing Museum like visuals.  Eventually we got on an elevator.  Approximately 55 seconds later, the three of us were up on the 80th floor to see the introductory views.</p>
		<p>Looking out the windows showed how incredibly huge New York was.  Tall buildings everywhere, next tour each other, and water around Manhattan and beyond.  It felt like a futuristic city at times with all the unique buildings one by one by one.  I was absolutely in awe.  The only experience I'd had prior was of course, the (former) Sears Tower in Chicago.  I even wore the same University of Minnesota shirt I wore to Chicago 10 years prior to signify the event.  Certainly, Chicago rivals in views, but New York was larger on all sides.  Chicago, sitting on the edge of Lake Michigan, gave the view a three sided view rather than four.  Great views, but nothing like New York.  After walking to each side to take multiple pictures, we had one more elevator ride to the 86th floor, where even better views were available.</p>

		<p>When my Mom was 10, she visited New York City with her Mom and Ed Sherman.  She visited the Empire State Building too.  As you can see, the views have evolved in the past 50 years.  Hover over the picture below to see just how much time has changed in New York City.</p>

		<h1>86th Floor</h1>
		<h4>{{date}}</h4>
		<p>The main prize, of course, was the main observation deck on the 86th floor.  Worthy of the price, the 86th Floor provided 360 degree views of New York City, with an outside deck for glare-less views.  Not even the Sears Tower had that.  The views were magnificent, unbelievable and heavenly, all rolled in one.  I must have walked around the deck at least twice, taking every picture of every view I could.  I could have spent hours there, but obviously, we had other things to do.  It was a little windy, so I was slightly nervous of losing my phone, but thankfully, rails covered the deck, with enough gap to sneak my iPhone in to take uninteruppted pictures.  Jenn and Neal stayed inside as Jenn didn't like being so high outside.  She found it better than being at the Space Needle, which I persumed was because the Space Needle rotates.  That would make someone sick, but with the Empire State Building over twice as tall, I was surprised Jenn didn't find it too tall.  Still, she stayed inside.</p>
		<p>There is so many skyscrapers to see.  It amazes me that in any other state, a tower of 600 feet would be the dominating building in most states, but in New York City, only ranks 113th (as of June 2017).  Towers like 4 Times Square, the MetLife Building, and more stand out in the views, but are overshadowed by towers much much taller than them.  That's the amazing thing about New York City.  The tallest building to the north, the 432 Park Avenue, looks like an eyesore considering to the amazing architecture of classics like the Chrysler Building or 30 Rockefeller Center, but because it's much taller, it stands out even more.</p>

		<h4>{{date}}</h4>
		<p>Finally, I had to force myself to leave.  We had a show to go to.  As we headed back down the elevator, we stopped for souvenirs.  I found a shirt I really liked and got it.  Dad got his Father's Day gift here, a shirt and a hat.  We know how to spoil our Dad.  Finally, another 80 floor drop took us to the lobby.  A trip to Greenwich Village awaited to see a Ventriloquist and the World's Stupidest Dummy posing as a President.  An Uber ride, with the Taxis ignoring us, was all that stood between the Empire State Building and the Duplex.</p>
