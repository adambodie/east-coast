		<h1>Baltimore</h1>
			<p>What a difference the time of year can make upon one's impression of the city.  Having been in Baltimore for the first time during a snowstorm in 2013, the city had an entirely different feel during the late late spring evening when that snow and cold is replaced with clear skies and humidity.  Instead of having it constantly and digging your way through walking, the roads were clear and easy to navigate.</p>
			<p>Walking around the Inner Harbor was much more lively this time around.  From people listening to a live band perform at the Hard Rock Cafe to the flock of people having a good time walking around, Baltimore was ready to party.  Thereâ€™s plenty of fun around the Harbor, but at the time of night, it's unfortunate there's little to eat around the Harbor.  Unable to find a place to eat, it was time to head back to Laurel, but due to the unfortunate closing of their Silver Diner, we instead went to the next nearest Diner in Greenbelt.</p>

			<p>The Inner Harbor is full of fun places to visit.  The National Aquarium is one the more obvious places; it's ranked as one of the World's Best Aquariums.  The World Trade Center stands out in the middle of the Harbor.  And further down, there are a few fun places, like Ripley's Believe it or Not Odditorium.  But one particular visually striking place that always catches my eye is the restaurants/businesses at Pier 4.</p>
			<p>The center of Pier 4 is the Barnes & Noble.  The least interesting place of the bunch, as it is just your typical chain bookstore.  Since we visited at night, it was closed.  Clearly, no action was happening then.  But the restaurants are what brings the heart and soul of the Pier.  To the left is a seafood restaurant named Phillips.  Looks like a fancy place, and with outdoor seating on the harbor itself, it would be a great summer hangout to sit back and relax.  To the right of the Barnes & Noble is the Hard Rock Cafe.  More fun than Phillips, the Hard Rock Cafe was the place to hang out at night, as a live band was performing outdoor along the Harbor.  Covering famous songs including Prince's classic Purple Rain, there's always plenty of action at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Unfortunately, we would have been better off showing up earlier in the evening.  By the time we got there, the kitchen had already closed.  Still fun to walk around the area.</p>
			<p>Those are the big three businesses at the Pier, but other ones hide themselves well.  One place I found was Dick's Last Resort, which had a tropic theme.  Sitting outside was a grumpy looking statue, whom I'm assuming is Dick, wearing a Hawaiian Shirt, shorts and holding a beer.  I didn't want to attempt to pick its nose; that's more of Jenn's thing, and since I ran off to go picture crazy, I didn't get around to showing Jenn grumpy old Dick.</p>
